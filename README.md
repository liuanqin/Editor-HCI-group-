This prototype is designed for text editing using a stylus on touchscreen devices. 
I would recommend user using an ipad pro and Apple Pencil to try this out. 
User can open an browser on touchscreen and enter weblink 'http://www3.nd.edu/~aliu1/text_editor_final.html'.

The prototype is able to recognize handwriting with the help of MyScript cloud service, which means a stable wifi connection is necessary.
So far, the prototype supports text insertion ('v') and text deletion ('——‘）. 
When insertion caret is drawn, the to-be-inserted place will generate space dynamically.
